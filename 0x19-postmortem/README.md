Postmortem: Outage in Web Stack Services

Issue Summary:
Duration: June 10, 2023, 15:00 UTC - June 11, 2023, 03:00 UTC
Impact: Slow response and intermittent downtime experienced by users accessing our web application. Approximately 30% of users were affected during the outage period.

Timeline:
- 15:00 UTC: The issue was detected when my monitoring system alerted us about increased response times.
- Investigation began immediately to identify the root cause.
- Initially, the assumption was that the issue could be related to network connectivity or server overload.
- Several teams, including the networking, infrastructure, and application teams, were involved in the investigation.
- Misleading investigation paths included analyzing network logs and reviewing server metrics, which did not yield conclusive results.
- As the severity of the issue escalated, the incident was eventually escalated to the senior engineering team for further assistance.
- 03:00 UTC: The incident was resolved, and services were fully restored.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfigured load balancer that was not distributing traffic evenly across the web servers. This resulted in some servers being overwhelmed while others were underutilized, leading to performance degradation and occasional downtime.

Resolution: To fix the issue, the load balancer configuration was adjusted to evenly distribute traffic across the web servers. Additionally, we implemented automated health checks to monitor the status of individual servers and removed any underperforming servers from the load balancing pool until they were restored to a healthy state.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
1. Regular Load Balancer Audits: Conduct periodic audits of load balancer configurations to ensure optimal traffic distribution and eliminate misconfigurations.
2. Load Testing: Perform regular load testing to assess the scalability and performance of the web application, identifying any bottlenecks or limitations in advance.
3. Monitoring Enhancements: Improve monitoring systems to provide early detection of load balancer anomalies, server performance issues, and response time degradation.
4. Incident Response Training: Provide additional training to the engineering teams on incident response procedures and escalation paths to ensure efficient handling of future incidents.
5. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing: Document the root cause analysis and resolution steps, and share the findings across teams to enhance collective knowledge and improve troubleshooting capabilities.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Review load balancer configurations and ensure proper distribution of traffic across web servers.
2. Implement automated health checks for servers, with notifications and automatic removal from the load balancer pool in case of performance issues.
3. Conduct load testing to assess scalability and identify potential bottlenecks.
4. Enhance monitoring systems to detect load balancer anomalies and server performance degradation.
5. Organize incident response training sessions to improve the team's incident handling capabilities.
6. Document the incident, including root cause analysis, resolution steps, and preventative measures, and share it with the relevant teams.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the occurrence of similar outages in the future, ensuring a more reliable and seamless experience for our users.
