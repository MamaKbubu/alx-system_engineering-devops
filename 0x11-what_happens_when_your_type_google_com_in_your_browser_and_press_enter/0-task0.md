When you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter, a series of steps occur that allow you to access Google's website. Understanding these steps is crucial for anyone working with web technologies. In this post, I will cover each step in detail.

1. DNS request

The first step is for your browser to translate the domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. This process is called DNS resolution. Your browser sends a DNS request to a DNS server, which is responsible for maintaining a database of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

The DNS server responds to the request with the IP address of the web server that hosts the website. If the DNS server doesn't have the IP address, it will forward the request to another DNS server until it finds the correct IP address.

2. TCP/IP

Once your browser has the IP address, it uses the TCP/IP protocol to establish a connection to the web server. This protocol breaks the data into small packets and sends them across the internet. The packets are reassembled when they reach the web server.

3. Firewall

Before the connection is established, it must pass through any firewalls between your computer and the web server. A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It is responsible for allowing or blocking traffic based on a set of predefined rules.

4. HTTPS/SSL

If the website uses HTTPS, your browser will initiate a TLS handshake to establish a secure connection. This handshake involves a series of steps to verify the website's identity and exchange encryption keys.

Once the secure connection is established, your browser and the web server can exchange data without the risk of eavesdropping or tampering.

5. Load-balancer

If the website receives a large amount of traffic, it may use a load-balancer to distribute the traffic across multiple web servers. A load-balancer is a device or software that monitors the traffic and sends it to the most available server. This ensures that no server is overloaded and the website remains responsive.

6. Web server

Once the connection is established and any load-balancers have done their job, the web server receives the request from your browser. The web server is responsible for retrieving the requested files and sending them back to your browser.

7. Application server

If the website uses dynamic content, such as a search engine or a social network, it may use an application server to generate the content. The application server receives the request from the web server and generates the appropriate response based on the user's input.

8. Database

Finally, the application server may need to retrieve data from a database to generate the content. The database stores all the information needed to run the website, such as user accounts, posts, and comments. The application server retrieves the necessary data from the database and includes it in the response sent back to your browser.

In conclusion, typing "https://www.google.com" in your browser and pressing Enter involves a complex series of steps, from DNS resolution to database retrieval. Understanding how each step works is crucial for anyone working with web technologies, as it allows them to diagnose and fix any issues that may arise.
